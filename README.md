## Quick Reference 

Where to Find Help in the Curriculum

You may find you need to review certain skills to meet the project requirements. The following tips can help you refresh your knowledge and overcome any obstacles you encounter:
Deploying to Heroku

Review Module 11: Express.js, Lesson 1: Set Up Express.js Server and GET Routes (especially 11.1.6 Deploy to Heroku); Module 13: Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Lesson 5: Create the Comment Model and Deploy to Heroku (especially 13.5.6: Deploy to Heroku); and Module 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Lesson 5: The Dashboard View (especially 14.5.6: Create an Edit Post Page) to get a refresher on deploying to Heroku.
RESTful APIs

For a reminder on how to create a RESTful API with GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data, look at Module 11: Express.js, Lesson 1: Set Up Express.js Server and GET Routes and Lesson 2: Create Data Using POST Routes (along with the rest of Module 11).

For implementation with a database, see Module 12: SQL, Lesson 2: Create Candidate Routes, Lesson 3: Join with Parties Table, and Lesson 4: Create Voter Table and Routes.

For implementation with the Sequelize ORM, look at Module 13: Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Lesson 1: Set Up a User Model, Lesson 2: Create the Login Route, Lesson 3: Create a Post Model, and Lesson 4: Implement a Voting System.
Connecting to a Database

For a refresher on connecting to a database, review Module 12: SQL, Lesson 1: Introduction to SQL and Module 13: Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Lesson 1: Set Up a User Model (especially 13.1.4: Scaffold the Application Architecture).
Environment Variables

For a reminder on how to add sensitive personal information to environment variables, revisit Module 13: Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Lesson 1: Set Up a User Model (especially 13.1.4: Scaffold the Application Architecture).
Authentication

Look at Module 13: Object Relational Mapping (ORM), Lesson 2: Create the Login Route and Module 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Lesson 2: Create the User Login and Lesson 5: Create the Dashboard View to review adding authentication to your application.
MVC Folder Structure

To review structuring your application to follow the MVC paradigm, look at Module 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Lesson 1: The Homepage View (especially 14.1.4: Set Up the Template Engine).
Templating

Revisit Module 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Lesson 1: The Homepage View (especially 14.1.4: Set Up the Template Engine) to review templating and setting up Handlebars.js.
